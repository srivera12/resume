            ><h3>The Complete Web Developer Course: Build 20 Websites</h3>
          </a>
          <p>
            This course covered some foundational HTML and CSS skills in a project-based setting. Throughout the course,
            I made quite a few websites with varying structures, designs and styles. By the time I started this course, 
            I had a fairly strong handle on these skills, so this course was straightforward and I completed it quickly.
            It was a good opportunity to really drill into my CSS skills and get more confident through repetition.

            ><h3>JavaScript Beginner Bootcamp</h3>
          </a>
          <p>
            With this bootcamp, I was able to really focus in on my Javascript skills to gain a solid foundation. While
            working through the content, I developed a confidence to write my own JS code to do what I wanted, rather
            than just repeating the same things I've seen instructors do in previous courses. During this course I made
            the To-Do Tracker and Quote Machine that you can check out and use in the "Projects" section of this site.

          </a>
          <p>
            This course included more recent functionalities of HTML5, CSS3, and JS6, but also added jQuery and
            Bootstrap. My personal favorite part of this course was the Pipboy from Bethesda's Fallout games, a project
            created with Bootstrap, jQuery, and vanilla Javascript.

            ><h3>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - Certification Course for Beginners</h3>
          </a>
          <p>
            In this course, I took my first formal foray into the world of web development. From the baby steps of basic
            HTML document structure, to CSS stylings and cool hover effects, to the (at the time) complexities of
            JavaScript conditionals and loops.
