It marked the first time I felt confident enough in my abilities and understanding to improve upon something I was shown in a course. While I may not have been able to add all the functionality I wanted at that point, this project gave me a chance to really develop my skills and push myself, and because of that it is an important stepping stone that showcases my progress."},{pathName:"montessori-quotes-app",name:"Montessori Quotes App",picPath:"/images/quoteApp.png",projectLink:"/projects/montessori-quote/index.html",githubLink:"https://github.com/srivera12/projects/tree/master/montessori-quote",blurb:"Simple quote app I made for my mom, who is a Montessori teacher.

I needed to research how selects worked in order to know how 'value' worked.","Not only did I want to search by topic/source, but I also didn't want to have to hard code the options in the select.

While I used the project from the course as the base for this, a Montessori quote app is something that I wanted to make for awhile.

Since I was using a d20, I instead needed to find and make my own images, particularly for each of the numbers the die could roll.","I had some difficulty dynamically rendering the images. At first it seemed that I might need to import all of the images, and then dynamically select which to render, but I was able to store the image path in a variable and dynamically change that to fit which image I wanted to render.","At first it was rendering the image with the rolled number immediately, which looked odd while the image was still doing the rolling animation. However, I was able to use a conditional tied to the 'isRolling' state to have it briefly render a blank d20 until the animation stopped."],reflections:"Even though I originally made it as a more interesting version of a simple exercise in a course, this has ended up being one of  the apps I created that gets the most use. Both I and others I play DnD with have used it on several occasions.

Once I was done switching everything to be functional components and use state with hooks, I needed to refactor again because we had been introduced to the concepts of a context, and so on.","This project gave me a chance to get familiar with using Material UI components. I had used them in a limited sense before, but using them extensively here let me better understand how to use them effectively, as well as how to customize the styles to fit what I wanted.","Having to change the method for syncing with local storage to fit each refactor helped me really understand how that process worked, which was very helpful for the next project I made."],reflections:"This project definitely feels like an 'all grown up' version of my JavaScript to-do app. It has a lot of the same functionality and a similar appearance, but it looks a lot better and has all of the functionality I originally wanted the JavaScript one to have.
