    text: "Welcome to my portfolio website! I created this as a way to introduce myself and my software engineering skills to the world. I've been learning coding for several months now, and I wanted to experiment with my newfound skills.

    subtitle: 'Session 0',
    text: "I didn't start out coding. I had a variety of interests growing up, and it was hard to settle on one for college. I decided to lean into my interest in science by studying Environmental Science and Geology. I also worked as a writing tutor and a learning assistant in several environmental science classes. All of this gave me a breadth of experience and knowledge I can draw from to approach challenges and problems.",

    subtitle: 'My Journey to Coding',
    text: "I loved studying Environmental Science, but I wasn't excited by the idea of staying in academia. Since I enjoyed my time tutoring, and loved learning and sharing my knowledge, I decided to pursue a career in education. I received a Masters in Elementary Education from Johns Hopkins while teaching full time, and taught for 4 years in total. It was a privilege working with the wonderful children I taught, and my experience in that career greatly increased my skills in problem-solving, creative thinking, adaptability, and resiliency.",

    subtitle: 'Choosing the Right Character Class',
    text: "Teaching was fufilling in many ways, but I realized it wasn't my passion. While looking into other things that sparked my interest, coding was suggested to me. I was immediately hooked - it had all the tech, math, and puzzle-solving aspects I had been missing. I started taking online classes in software development through Stackskills and Udemy, and never looked back. Nothing quite beats the exhilaration of figuring out how to get a complicated process to work, or the satisfaction of creating apps that are useful to me or others. ",

    subtitle: "When I'm Not Coding",
    text: "As much as I love coding, it isn't the only thing in my life. I'm close to my family and I love spending time with them, and spending time with my friends. In case it isn't obvious, I'm also a big fan of DnD (Dungeons and Dragons). It's a lot of fun to flex creative thinking and problem-solving in a fun and complicated fantasy world, as well as the soft skills of working together in a social setting. I've been in a few DnD campaigns and I even DM! I also read a lot, love spending time outside, and enjoy playing video games.",
